Hello and welcome to my app!
here you will find the opportunity to look for super good deals at Best Buy.

Now you might be asking yourself, how can I do that?
If you are a new user that hasn’t set up an account with us:
click join us and create an account!
after your account is set up, it will send you to our search bar.
In the search bar enter name of item you are looking for (example: laptop).
All of the items that match your input and are also 40% or more off will populate.
There just go ahead and choose which items you’d like to snag into your cart by clicking add to cart button!
Now the items you chose are assigned to your shopping cart and you can choose your option to check out straight at the Best Buy website.
I hope you enjoy saving on all of your Best Buy purchases.
